Robert is trapped in an endless loop! Rescue him from his predicament by using the knowledge of coordinates and quadrants.

Controls:

To drag/drop an item â€“ press and hold the item of interest using the touchpad or mouse. While pressing, slide towards where you want to drop the item, and then release the touchpad or mouse left button.

Change a placed item's coordinate - you can drag and drop a placed item on the board to reposition it.

You can delete a placed item on the level by pressing it for a second.

To clear all items on the board, press and hold the CLEAR button (red) during edit mode (when the stop button is pressed).

Hints:
After a few tries, a hint button will display at the bottom left (light-bulb). Press this button to display a list of items with hints on where to place them (e.g. Quadrant 1 = place matching item somewhere in Quadrant 1). A star will appear beside the item if you placed the matching item on the board at the exact coordinate.
